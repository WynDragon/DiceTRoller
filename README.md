# DiceTRoller
It's a roller for dice in DnD 5e! Absolutely no gimmicks involved. :) 

Okay, in all seriousness, this is a practice and semi-serious project. The idea is to implement a die roller that will calculate your roll to hit and damage at the same time. Things the app will do:
-Take your ability score into account (add your stats and you're good to go!)
-Take advantage or disadvantage into account (pick adv or disadv)
-Add your proficiency bonus to the die roll
-Have an option for you to turn off the background music
-Play Mitchirineko (song by Mitchiri-Neko Marching Band) and/or Bongo Cat (song by CG5)
